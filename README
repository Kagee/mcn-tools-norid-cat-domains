This list is based on the non-machine-readable data
at [1] and [2].

It includes domains from all lists, excluding
- "Navn som er forbudt av tekniske årsaker"
- "Diverse"
- "Mulige fremtidige kategoridomener"

This means there are reserved (not only valid)
domains in this list, but for my purposes this is OK.

All names that contains "oe" has been commented out from
05, 07 and 08 as all these appears to be reserved, not valid.

not valid.

The municipalities Bø, Herøy, Nes, Os, Sande and Våler

counties.

The gs.<county>.no-placeholder in 01 has been expanded
using the two-letter+oslo counties from 03

other appears to be reserved, not valid.
